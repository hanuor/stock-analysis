The US stock market is open Monday to Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

Many stocks can also be bought and sold in extended-hours trading. Pre-market trading opens at 4:00 a.m. and after-hours trading closes at 8 p.m.

Stock trading hours are usually noted in Eastern Time because that's the time zone of New York, where Wall Street is.

In other US time zones, the stock market opens at 8:30 a.m. Central Time, 7:30 a.m. Mountain Time and 6:30 a.m. Pacific Time.

## Futures trading hours

Types of securities called futures contracts can be traded almost around the clock Monday through Friday. For example, futures on the [S&P500](/what-is-the-best-sp500-etf/) Index (called E-mini S&P 500 futures) can be traded from 6:00 p.m. on Sunday to 5:00 p.m. on Friday.

However, there is a break in E-mini futures trading between 4:15 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. each day.

Other types of futures contracts may have different trading hours, such as commodity and currency futures.

## Option trading hours

Most options contracts on US stock exchanges can only be traded between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST, the same as regular trading hours for stocks.

## Cryptocurrencies

Most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are traded around the clock, all year.

## The bottom line

Knowing when the market opens and closes is important to know when to [place your trades](/how-to-buy-stocks-online/) and check your positions.

If you submit an order outside of regular stock market hours, then the order may not get filled until the market opens.

Some brokers allow you to trade during extended hours, but this is not recommended for beginners. That's because there is less liquidity at this time, and your order may not get filled at a good price.
